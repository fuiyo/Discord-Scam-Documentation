A Documentation About How Discord Scam Works.

### Before Getting Started...
Here's some tips to prevent you from getting scammed on Discord.

1. Do not click on any links sent by anyone (in a server or dm), including your friend (in some cases). 
2. Turn off your dm ( settings > privacy & safety > disable direct messages from server members ).
3. Check the user's account creation date, name & avatar, see if its sketchy.
4. Read the message carefully, check for grammar/spelling mistakes. 
5. In conclusion, don't click on any links.

### Many users got scammed, but why ?
1. They thought it was legit.
2. Greedy.
3. Curiosity.
4. Very attractive.
5. Seen many times.
6. Sent from a friend.

> If its a nitro link, you'll be able to claim it straight away with the `accept` button.

### What will happen if someone's account was scammed/hacked ?
> Hmm, you might notice that I'm using the word **hack**, but actually its phishing and they're similar in one way but different in another ( for this scam, its still the same ).

So, if someone's account got scammed, more users will get their account scammed ( by that account ), they might leak their banking information, if they had to the scammer as well. Like, think of someone having full access to your account ( your server, your friends, people you know ).

### What's the point of doing this ?
Well, you've guessed it, personal information (banking information and stuff like that). Imagine if 1000 people fell for that scam, there's probably one user that linked their banking information to their Discord account. 

### Ways of getting your account hacked/scammed...
1. Fake Login Page where you typed in your email and password.
2. A Script ( self-xss ), listen to this advice from Discord :
```
If someone told you to copy/paste something here you have an 11/10 chance you're being scammed. 
Pasting anything in here could give attackers access to your Discord account. 
Unless you understand exactly what you are doing, close this window and stay safe. 
```
3. Script Injector, a script from another website that was injected into the your Discord client.
4. And more...
